               <li> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is not just a name but a feeling. He was the 11th President of India. </li><br>
                <li>He was one of the greatest scientists and is known for his achievements in the field of science. He is also popularly known as the Missile man of India. </li><br>
                <li>He was a man of power, status, knowledge, and virtue.</li> <br>
                <li>Born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalam is a great motivator for many. He was born in a middle-class Muslim family and witnessed many struggles.</li> <br>
                <li>Even after that he never gave up and moved ahead on the path of determination and success. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. Since the beginning, he had a very keen interest to study. </li> <br>
                <li>He served DRDO and ISRO as the scientist.He was a man of dreams and ideas.</li><br>
                <li>He dreamt of making India one of the super-powers in the world. His idea of dreaming was really different. He emphasized that the dreams are not those which you see when you sleep but are those which never let you sleep. </li><br>
                <li>Some countless efforts and contributions are made by Dr. Kalam for the sake of the nation. He was awarded by Bharat Ratna in the year 1997.</li> <br>
                <li>While delivering his speech at the Institute of Management, Shillong he got cardiac arrest and collapsed.
                     He left us, making 27 July 2015 one of the saddest days in the history of India.</li> <br>
                <li> To conclude, I would like to say even though he left us, he is still in our hearts. His golden words and miraculous deeds will always be remembered.</li>  <br>
                <h2>Achievement of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
                <li>In 1960, Dr Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) (DRDO) after he finished his graduation from the Madras Institute of Technology.</li><br>
                <li>In DRDO, Kalam was responsible for designing helicopters for the Indian Army. </li><br>
                <li>Dr Kalam was selected as the project director for SLV-III, India’s first indigenous satellite launch vehicle, after he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</li><br>
                <li>After SLV-III was successful in launching the satellite Rohini to orbit in July 1980, Dr Kalam started expanding India’s space programme on a wider scale.</li><br>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <li>Under his command, he had a team of India’s best soldiers.</li><br>
                <li>He simultaneously served as Prime Minister’s Chief Scientific Adviser from July 1992 to December 1999, and also the Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li><br>
                <li>In 1998, Kalam and Dr Soma Raju collaborated to design a low-cost coronary stent. The stent was dubbed the “Kalam-Raju Stent.” For rural health care, the “Kalam-Raju Tablet” was created in 2012.</li><br>
                <li>The Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998 proved India’s nuclear capabilities. Without Dr Kalam’s assistance, this project would not have been possible. Such weapons, he explained to the international community, would serve solely as “weapons of peace” to discourage other countries from the annexation of Indian territory.</li><br>
                <li>As the leader of India’s missile programme in the 1980s, political parties came together in 2002 to elect APJ Abdul Kalam as the country’s eleventh president.</li>
